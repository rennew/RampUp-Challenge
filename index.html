	<p>That's me.<br>  Well, me and "the three" - T.Ray, Lux and Stelle.<br> I still think of myself as a single girl living the artsy life in the city...<br>but I drive a minivan and live in Sudbury. Go figure! <br>  I'm a trained jeweler, and received my training through the <a href="www.nbss.edu">North Bennet Street School</a>.<br>  Since 2004 I have run <a href="www.powdermillstudio.com">Powder Mill Studio </a>, and hope to someday soon focus on a new venture, "Ecogagement," creating environmntally sustainable engagement rings. <br> I'm also incredibly excited to learn more about graphic and web design and how to take those ideas live. <br> Let's Go!
